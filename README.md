# Professional-README-Generator

## Description

In this project I was tasked with building a README generator for future projects. Users using the terminal are prompted to input information that will be used to populate the various fields in a standard README markdown file, including a project title, description, installation instructions, usage instructions, credits, a license chosen from a list of common open licenses, testing instructions, and e-mail and github contacts for further question.

The main problems I faced with this project were the use of back-end functions involving NodeJS. I had to initializing a package from NPM, as well as link multiple javascript files together for full functionality. Finally, I had demonstrate an ability to write new files in order to generate the final README markdown.

The following clip is a walkthrough of the program functionality that I used with Screencastify:
